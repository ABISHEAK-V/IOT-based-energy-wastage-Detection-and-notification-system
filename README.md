# IOT-based-energy-wastage-Detection-and-notification-system
This project presents an IoT-based solution to reduce electricity wastage by monitoring appliance usage and human presence. An ESP32 microcontroller is used along with an ultrasonic sensor for occupancy detection and a current sensor for real-time power monitoring. When energy consumption is detected without human presence
